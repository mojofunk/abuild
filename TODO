Add an PKG_RELEASE environment variable and use it in install package
name

Instead of touching a file in the root directory to indicate a package
has been installed, add a directory to
$INSTALL_PATH/share/abuild/$PKG_NAME and then add the ABUILD file used
to build the package and possibly add an ACONFIG file that contains the
environment variables used for the build

Add argument to not process dependencies, or don't process deps by
default and add a -r(recursive) argument.

Add argument to link to system libs(via pkg-config) if installed or just
prefix PKG_CONFIG_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR?

Add argument to prefer checkout over release

Where we want to use binary versions, specify a list of the runtime
files to copy into the PREFIX.

if MSYS2 and SYSTEM_RUNTIME copy dll's etc to PKG_INSTALL_DIR

Append version to package build path...Use PKG_SRC_DIR? No, we want to
be able to use the same name as the checkout dir so that
PKG_BUILD_ROOT_DIR can be set in the environment to override and build
a "development" version of the code temporarily. What is needed is a way
to identify whether if a source directory already exists that it
corresponds to the version of the package that we are building. I think
a solution to this would be to touch a file like
$PKG_BUILD_DIR/$PKG_NAME-$PKG_VERSION.abuild and then if any other
.abuild files exist in the build directory then stop the build.


Should a PKG_RELEASE be added to differentiate changes/fixes between
builds?...probably.

gettext-0.19.8.1 is broken for 32bit mingw builds, it fixed
upstream(apparently) but no release yet.
