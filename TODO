Add an PKG_RELEASE environment variable and use it in install package
name

Instead of touching a file in the root directory to indicate a package
has been installed, add a directory to
$INSTALL_PATH/share/abuild/$PKG_NAME and then add the ABUILD file used
to build the package and possibly add an ACONFIG file that contains the
environment variables used for the build

Add argument to not process dependencies, or don't process deps by
default and add a -r(recursive) argument.

Add argument to link to system libs(via pkg-config) if installed or just
prefix PKG_CONFIG_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR?

Where we want to use binary versions, specify a list of the runtime
files to copy into the PREFIX.

if MSYS2 and SYSTEM_RUNTIME copy dll's etc to PKG_INSTALL_DIR

Should a PKG_RELEASE be added to differentiate changes/fixes between
builds?...probably.
